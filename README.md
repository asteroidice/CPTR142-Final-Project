Search and sort arrays quickly

Searching for codes in "alien transmissions". There is a repetitive code in the 2000 bytes of information.
Find the repititions that follow the pattern of the first 28 bytes, output the time it takes to run the code
(in microseconds), output the number of times the pattern shows up and the address for each function.
Also includes the clock function code.
